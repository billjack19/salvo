; This INI file is used to provide the paper choices a user may choose from when
; creating new label designs.
;
; The DEF file consists of a [LABELS] section, which defines the types of labels a user
; can create, and, for each label type listed in the LABELS section, a corresponding
; section with the particular label attributes.
;
; The entries in the LABELS section include the "friendly' name, E.G. 'Address Label', as
; the key, and the PaperName (as known by the driver) as the Value (e.g. 'Address').
;
; In the individual sections for each label listed in the LABELS section, are attributes.
; These attributes define the orientation, Size, and other relevant attributes. The
; list of attributes includes:
;   NAME            POSSIBLE VALUES (* = Default)
;   Orientation     Portrait, *Landscape
;   Width           1..1440, Width, in TWIPS, Defaults to 3.5 inch length
;   Height          1..1440, Height in TWIPS, Defaults to 1.125 inch length
;   StockType       *Label, Paper, Card, Plastic, Other
;   Labels          Number of labels represented, defaults to 1
;   LabelSize       X,Y - Used to specify width and height of label for
;               n-up labels. If not provided, defaults to Width and
;               Height values.
;
; In addition to the label attributes contained in the individual sections
; is a list of draw commands that are used to create a bitmap that looks like the label.
; These draw commands can have any useful name as the key (e.g. draw1, draw 2, outline, etc.).
; The VALUE for each key can be one of three things:
;       Rectangle       - Used to specify rectangular regions
;       RoundRectangle  - Used to specify rectangular regions with rounded corners
;       FoldLine            - Used to specify the start and end points for a dotted fold-line.
;
;   There can be up to 10 combined Rectangle and RoundRectangles specified, but
;   only one FoldLine may be specified.
;   Rectangles and RoundRectangles can be combined together, subtracted from each other,
;   or combine exclusively. The default is to combine them to give multiple regions.
;   The actions to be taken are specified using the 'Action' key word, and may be one of:
;       Action(add) - adds another region to the current bitmap
;       Action(Subtract) - Removes a region from the current bitmap (as in the hole of a cassette label)
;       Action(Xor) - combines the non-overlapping regions to form the bitmap.
;
; IMPORTANT: The FIRST REGION must always have an action of ADD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
;
;   Syntax:
;       Rectangle(X1, Y1, X2, Y2), Action(add)
;       RoundRectangle(X1, Y1, X2, Y2, Rx, Ry), Action(add)
;
;   In the above, X1,Y1 give the upper left corner (relative to the label's overall width and height)
;   of the region, and X2,Y2, specify the lower right corner.
; For the Rounded Rectangle, Rx and Ry specify the radius position relative to the upper left corner.
;   All values are in TWIPS.
;
; In need of a way to draw cutout shapes on a label, the command "CutoutShape"
; was created. The command is very equivalent to a "RoundRect" command with
; the additional "Pen Style" parameter. The command, however, does not need the
; "Action" clause since the only applicable action is add.
; You can think of the "CutoutShape" command as a more comprehesive "FoldLine"
; command.
;
; The following is a description of available PenStyles:
;   0 - psSolid A solid line.
;   1 - psDash  A line made up of a series of dashes.
;   2 - psDot   A line made up of a series of dots.
;   3 - psDashDot   A line made up of alternating dashes and dots.
;   4 - psDashDotDot    A line made up of a series of dash-dot-dot combinations.
